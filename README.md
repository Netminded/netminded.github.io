# NetMinded Homepage Gatsby/React App

Please review the `README.md` in the `development` branch for instructions on how to run the project.

**Note - Any changes to the `main` branch will appear live on the production website. So the `main` branch should only be used for deployment of the `build` static files and not have other branches merged into it or commits made to it directly.**
=======
# NetMinded Website Gatsby/React App


## Setup

To use the project clone it then cd into to the `netminded.github.io` folder and checkout the development branch.

### `git checkout development`

Once on the `development` branch run the following to install necessary packages. Gatsby can be installed using `npm install -g gatsby-cli` if you don't already have it. 

### `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

Create an `.env.production` file in the project root and fill the required variables `GATSBY_ANALYTICS_ID=""`, `GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID=""`, `GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID_MNOC_TRUSTPILOT=""`,`GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID_NETPROVE=""` and `GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID_MNOC_DMARC=""` with the NetMinded Google Analytics ID and Formspree ID. 
An `.env.development` file should also be created too and this needs to contain the Formspree variables `GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID=""`, `GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID_MNOC_TRUSTPILOT=""`,`GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID_NETPROVE=""`  and `GATSBY_FORMSPREE_ID_MNOC_DMARC=""` to test Formspree locally (Formspree domain whitelisting may need to be temporarily disabled to test locally). Variables which are required in the browser should be prefixed with `GATSBY_`. Variables which are to be kept private should not be prefixed. 


## Running the Project

To run the app in development mode and to view it in your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) run the below command. 
The browser will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console. 
**Note - All changes to project files should be made to new branches e.g. `git checkout -b feature/feature-name` and merged into the `development` branch, not the `main` branch.** 
To view and query the site data (which uses GraphQL), open [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) to use the GraphiQL browser IDE.

### `gatsby develop`

When adding new pages, importing new fonts and before building and deploying the following should be run. This creates/updates a `font-preload-cache.json` file which pre-loads fonts for improved performance.

### `npm run preload-fonts`

Any input fields and other relevant content should be validated and tested. This project uses Jest for testing. To create new tests either add a `__test__` folder where one does not exist or add test files to existing `__test__` folders. Test files should include a relevant name followed by `test.js`, for example, `contact.test.js`. Tests can be run using the following:

### `npm test`


## Adding a Blog Post

**Before adding a new blog post/article first do a git pull of the development branch to make sure you have the latest version of the project.**

Within the articles directory create a new folder with the name of the blog post/article. The folder name will form the slug for the blog post/article e.g. `/my-article`. Folder names should be lowercase and any spaces should utilise hyphens (-). 

After creating a folder navigate inside the folder and creade an `index.mdx` file, this is where blog post/article content will go. Every blog post/article should have its own index and index files are written in `Markdown`. 

An index file should always contain the following header section:

```
---
title: "A Great Blog Title!"
date: "2024-08-23"
author: "Author Name"
hero_image: "./Name_Of_Hero_Image.png"
hero_image_alt: "A description of the hero image"
tags: ["connectivity", "ethernet", "fault management", "networking"]
---
```

After the header the blog post/article content can be added (see other article/blog posts in the articles directory for examples).

Any images you wish to include (including the blog post/article hero image) should be added to the same blog post/article folder as the index file. Images can then be referenced within the index using `./Image_Name.png`. 

Whilst working on the blog post/article you can preview it at `http://localhost:8000/blog/article-name`. When you're happy with the blog post/article first **commit the changes and merge into to the development branch before deploying**. Then deploy the project.


## Deploying

When ready to deploy the below command can be run. As part of the deployment a build script runs building the app for production to the `public` folder. 
Once complete the `public` folder is automatically deployed to the `main` branch on GitHub which has been configured in the `package.json` file.

### ðŸš€ `npm run deploy`

**Note - Any changes to the `main` branch will appear live on the production website. So the `main` branch should only be used for deployment of the `build` static files and not have other branches merged into it or commits made to it directly.**
