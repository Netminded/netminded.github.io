                            <p>PREAMBLE</p>
                            <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of
                                collaborative font
                                projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
                                a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
                            <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed
                                freely as long as they
                                are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
                                redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative
                                works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.
                                The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the
                                fonts or their derivatives.</p>
                            <p>DEFINITIONS</p>

                                whole -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the
                                Font Software to a new environment.</p>
                            <p>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other

                            <p>PERMISSION & CONDITIONS</p>
                            <p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the
                                Font Software, to
                                use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the
                                Font Software,
                                subject to the following conditions:</p>
                            <p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or
                                Modified Versions, may
                                be sold by itself.</p>
                            <p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed
                                and/or sold with any
                                software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license.
                                These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
                                machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily
                                viewed by the user.</p>
                            <p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless
                                explicit written
                                permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the
                                primary font name
                                as presented to the users.</p>
                            <p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software
                                shall not be used to
                                promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
                                Copyright Holder(s)
                                and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.</p>
                            <p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
                                distributed entirely under
                                this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain
                                under this license does not
                                apply to any document created using the Font Software.</p>
                            <p>TERMINATION</p>
                            <p>This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.</p>
