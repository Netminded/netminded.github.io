Getting this right in part dictates the cost of delivery and the cost of your Net Promoter Score (or your Trustpilot!!) rating. Of course, this has a direct effect on your cost of customer acquisition/customer retention metrics. The Operations Team needs to influence this customer communication and be aware of it. Working with Marketing to ensure that the reality of service delivery plans and capabilities meets the expectations set with the customer. At NetMinded we call the predicted output of the customer expectation vs. the reality equation the \\\"Expected Outcomes\\\" score. As an example - if you say it's a 1Gbps Internet service in your marketing - make sure the operations team has the tools and processes to prove this. And prove it easily!

Marketing has the tools and the skills to build customer personas that can help your Product and Operations team better understand varying needs.
